Welcome to my Git. 

Here I document the codes used to complete my dissertation analyses. 

Portions of the R code used for data analysis in this dissertation were generated with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), per the following list. 
These tools supported the ideation and structuring of code but were not used to run or validate any analyses. In some cases, code was generated, validated, and optimized by either LLM.
All execution and interpretation of results were conducted independently by the author.

  1. ChatGPT (4o, Code Copilot)
  2. Claude
  3. Copilot by Microsoft
  4. Gemini by Google via Google Colab
