Dissertation Title: Advancing real-time risk stratification: Evaluating the associations between comorbidities and hospitilazation outcomes in patients with multimorbidity.

Aim 1: Characterize chronic diseases found in patients with multimorbidity among subgroups.
Aim 2: Evaluate assosciations beween combinations of chronic diseases and hospitalization outcomes (length of stay, costs, mortality) of paitients with multimorbidity among subgroups (age, race, sex, ethnicity).

Here I document the codes used to achieve my Aims. 

Portions of the R code used for data analysis in this dissertation were generated with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), per the following list. 
These tools supported the thought and structure of the codes but were not used to run or validate any analyses. In some cases, code was generated, validated, and optimized by either LLM and using another LLM.
All execution and interpretation of results were conducted solely by the author, via RStudio.
