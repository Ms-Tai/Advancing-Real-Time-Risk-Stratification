Welcome to my Git. 

Here I document the codes used to complete my dissertation analyses. 

Portions of the R code used for data analysis in this dissertation were generated with the assistance of large language models (LLMs), per the following list. 
These tools supported the thought and structure of the codes but were not used to run or validate any analyses. In some cases, code was generated, validated, and optimized by either LLM and using another LLM.
All execution and interpretation of results were conducted solely by the author, via RStudio.

  2. Claude
  3. Copilot by Microsoft
  4. Gemini by Google via Google Colab
